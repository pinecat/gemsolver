## [0.1.0] - 2023-08-23
First release. The library is still fairly small, but there are a reasonable amount of tests, and
it is fulfilling all the functionality it needs to, so far.
### Added
- An install generator, which creates an initializer for GemCache.
- Methods to fetch:
  - An info file (<host>/info/<gem>)
  - A quick file (<host>/quick/Marshal.4.8/<gem>-<version>.gemspec.rz)
  - A gem file (<host>/gems/<gem>-<version>.gem)
- An info file parser.
- A semantic versioning parser (and dependency resolver).
- Custom errors:
  - GemNotFoundError: When any of the remote resources on <host> aren't available
  - InvalidVersionConstraintError: When an unrecognized version constraint is specified
  - NoAvailableVersionsError: When the constraints are too strict, or aren't inclusive enough
- Tests for the library.
- A proper README.md file.
